I'm interested to see how much I can expand my skills in programming languages.

they're well-researched?

## Learner(newbie) üî∞

I am learning new languages to discover which ones will be useful and efficient
for me. There are many resources available on the internet for learning,
but none of them seem to be a good fit. I believe that learning through
trial and error is the best way to learn.
I hope to be able to turn the ideas I have into reality with the
programming language and become useful.

### Hobbies üë®‚Äçüíª

Ever since I got my first computer at a young age, I became very interested in
computers and I was always searching and messing around with hardware, files and
operating systems until I got to know the concept of programming and I try to
learn new things every day.
I love trial and error to find the right way.

My main computer hobby is making errors.

> How can you fix an error when you don't have enough knowledge?

Let's work together to push the boundaries of what's possible. By combining our
skills and perspectives, we can create something amazingü§ù.
